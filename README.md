# AirSync

## Overview
AirSync monitors air quality, temperature, and humidity in real-time. It uses sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud integration to display environmental data on a dashboard.

---

## Features
- Tracks air quality, temperature, and humidity.
- Visualizes data through a cloud dashboard.
---

## Components
### Hardware
- Microcontrollers: Arduino Uno, ESP-32
- Sensors: MQ135, MQ7, DHT11
- Display: OLED (128x32)
- Push Button

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- Proteus
- Arduino Cloud
